# Phone Shop App

This is a simple phone shop app built with React and Express. It allows users to view a list of phones and their details.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and run the following commands:

```js

cd phone-shop-app
npm install
npm start

```

This will start the development server and open the app in your default browser.

The app has two routes:

- `/` - Home page that displays a welcome message
- `/phones` - Displays a list of phones

You can click on a phone to view its details at `/phones/:id`.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
